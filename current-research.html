                                    My current research focuses on several key areas related to crop responses to climate change and the physiological and molecular mechanisms of environmental stress tolerance. The primary stressors under investigation include salinity, drought, flood, and heavy metals/metalloids.

                                    The main objectives of our research include the screening of crop genotypes for stress tolerance and the exploration of the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms of oxidative stress tolerance. Our ultimate goal is to enhance the antioxidant defense system in crop plants. The research projects I am currently involved in have received funding from prestigious institutions such as the World Bank, FAO, the University Grants Commission of Bangladesh, and the Ministry of Science and Technology in Bangladesh.

                                    Over the years, I have supervised the dissertations of 30 Master's and 4 Ph.D. students. Active collaborations with researchers from over 30 countries have enriched our research endeavors. Our state-of-the-art Crop Science Laboratory at Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University is equipped with advanced research facilities.

                                    One of our notable achievements is the establishment of effective mechanisms for plant survival under adverse conditions like flood, drought, salinity, and metal toxicity. Our pioneering work has demonstrated the coordinated functioning of the antioxidant defense and glyoxalase systems in combating oxidative stress in plants.

                                    Significant progress has been made in the application of different exogenous protectants, including trace elements, antioxidants, phytohormones, and signaling molecules, to enhance plant tolerance to various abiotic stresses. Our research results are actively applied under field conditions, and we have recently entered into an agreement with Acadian Plant Health, a Canadian organization disseminating technologies for plant stress management.

                                    Our research facilities include a net house for physiological and agronomic investigations, as well as varietal screening. The Plant Physiology and Crop Science laboratory allows us to explore various plant physiological parameters, conduct enzyme and metabolite assays, and perform anatomical studies. Despite limited funding, we consistently publish at least 5 research articles in Q1/Q2 journals every year.
