                                    My current research foci include the crop responses to climate change and physiological and molecular mechanisms of environmental stress tolerance (salinity, drought, flood, and heavy metals/metalloids). Our research work is emphasized on agronomy and crop physiology. Our studies are focused on plant stress responses and tolerance. Our main task is to screen crop genotypes for stress tolerance and to investigate underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms of oxidative stress tolerance. We aim at enhancing the antioxidant defense system in crop plants. I have completed several research projects funded by the World Bank, FAO, the University Grants Commission of Bangladesh, the Ministry of Science and Technology (Bangladesh), and others. Prof. Hasanuzzaman supervised the dissertations of 30 Masters and 4 Ph.D. students. He has active collaboration with researchers from over 30 countries.

                                    I have established an advanced Crop Science Laboratory with state-of-the-art research facilities at Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University. During the last 12 years, he has been investigating the mechanisms of how the plant can survive under adverse environments like flood, drought, salinity and metal toxicity. He is one of the pioneers who has shown that antioxidant defense and glyoxalase system work coordinately in combating oxidative stress in plants. He has made tremendous progress in applying different exogenous protectants (trace elements, antioxidants, phytohormones, signaling molecules) in enhancing plants’ tolerance to various abiotic stress. His research results are now applied under field condition and recently he made an agreement with Acadian plant health – A Canadian organization that are dissemination technologies for plant stress management.

                                    We have a net house suitable for physiological and agronomic investigations as well as varietal screening. We have Plant Physiology and Crop Science laboratory where we can investigate different plant physiological parameters, enzyme and metabolite assay, as well as anatomical study. Although we have limited funding, we publish at least 5 research articles in Q1/Q2 journals every year.
